# Using FSI Viewer for 360째 Showcase Image Zoom - Points Of Interest

This readme describes how a simple example of a 360째 detail page including points of interest is achieved with *FSI Viewer*.
The aim of the demo is to show how you can easily integrate spin images with zoom by just adding a simple viewer tag.
The points of interest are achieved using the FSI ThumbBar.

# Add your images/ assets to FSI Server

The first thing you'll need to do is upload the images you want to use to FSI Server.
You can install a [demo version](https://www.neptunelabs.com/get/) via Docker or use our [online demo server](https://demo.fsi-server.com/fsi/interface/) to try it out first.

To display 360째 zoom with FSI Viewer, all you need to do is add the following script to the top of your website
at the top of your website:

```html
<script src='https://docs.neptunelabs.com/fsi/viewer/applications/viewer/js/fsiviewer.js'</script>
<script src="//docs.neptunelabs.com/fsi/viewer/applications/thumbbar/js/fsithumbbar.js"></script>
```
This will ensure that the FSI Viewer and FSI ThumbBar is loaded.

Next, you need to place the *<fsi-viewer>* tag you see in the Publish section where you want the viewer to appear.
In our example this looks like this

```html
   <fsi-viewer
  id="FSI_EDBeF84CxSVR"
  width="80%"
  height="100%"
  ir="/images/samples/cruiser/"
  backgroundColor="#f8f9fa"
  cfg="showcase_presets/showcase-cruiser.xml"
  plugins="Resize,FullScreen">
</fsi-viewer>
```

The difference between the normal 2D viewer and the 360째 viewer is that the latter uses *dir* instead of *src*.

Now we want to have some points of interest. This is achieved by setting them in an XML configuration.
This is discussed in a tutorial on our website: [Points Of Interest Tutorial](https://www.neptunelabs.com/fsi-viewer-js/multiple-spins-showcase/).

The resulting viewer with thumbbar looks like this:

```html
<div id="Container_FSI_EDBeF84CxSVR" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:700px;box-sizing:border-box;padding-right:200px;">
          <fsi-viewer id="FSI_EDBeF84CxSVR" width="80%" height="100%" debug="true" dir="/images/samples/cruiser/" backgroundColor="#f8f9fa" cfg="showcase_presets/showcase-cruiser.xml" plugins="Resize,FullScreen" fullScreenElement="Container_FSI_EDBeF84CxSVR">
          </fsi-viewer>
          <fsi-thumbbar viewerSelector="FSI_EDBeF84CxSVR" width="20%" height="100%" debug="true" style="position:absolute;bottom:0px;height:100%;width:200px;left:728px; text-align: center" cfg="showcase_presets/showcase-cruiser.xml" autoElementSpacing="true" elementWidth="20%" vertical="true"></fsi-thumbbar>
        </div>
```

For all the parameters that can be used, please refer to the [manual](https://docs.neptunelabs.com/fsi-viewer/latest/fsi-viewer).

## Testing with examples from your own server

To test the examples with images from your own [FSI Server](https://www.neptunelabs.com/fsi-server/), please first copy the env.yml.dist file to env.yml and adapt the file, then restart the main demo again.
